# heartSync

**heartSync** is a simple Flutter app designed to help with heart recovery. It aims to make vitals tracking feel a little more comforting and gentle. ðŸ’–

> Under Development!


## Whatâ€™s Built So Far

- A dashboard with cards for daily vitals (Heart Rate, Blood Sugar, etc.)
- Section for a progress timeline (streaks/check-ins... still in progress)


## Still In Progress

- Turtle animations (using Rive)
- Actual data syncing with Apple Health or wearables.
- Breathing challenges, mood logs, XP, and streak logic
- Graphs and vitals history 


## Why This Exists

heartSync was made to make recovery feel a little less mechanical â€” and a little more magical ðŸª„âœ¨
It isnâ€™t perfect, but itâ€™s growing slowly, like coral ðŸª¸
