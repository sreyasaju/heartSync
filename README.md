# heartSync

**heartSync** is a simple Flutter app designed to help with heart recovery. It aims to make vitals tracking feel a little more comforting and gentle. 💖

The design is inspired by calm underwater worlds, soft curves, and a turtle companion that offers quiet encouragement. 🐢

> Under Development!


## ✨ What’s Built So Far

- A dashboard with cards for daily vitals (Heart Rate, Blood Sugar, etc.)
- A coral-themed background with a curved ocean header.
- Section for a progress timeline (streaks/check-ins... still in progress)
- Clean component structure (for cards, navbar, side menu, etc.)


## 🌱 Still In Progress

- Turtle animations (using Rive)
- Actual data syncing with Apple Health or wearables.
- Breathing challenges, mood logs, XP, and streak logic
- Graphs and vitals history 


## Why This Exists

heartSync was made to rmake recovery feel a little less mechanical — and a little more magical 🪄✨
It isn’t perfect, but it’s growing slowly, like coral 🪸
